# Single-Molecule Sequencing Course Data

This repository provides access to datasets for the analysis and evaluation of DNA and RNA base modification detection using Oxford Nanopore Technologies' single-molecule direct RNA sequencing. 

## üìÅ Available Datasets

### Basecalled Reads ‚Äì Chr22 Subset (Dorado v1.0.0, All 8 Modifications)

This dataset includes reads aligned to **chromosome 22**, basecalled with **Dorado v1.0.0** using multi-modification models supporting the following modified bases:

- **m5C, 2‚Ä≤-O-methylcytidine (2OMeC)**
- **Inosine, m6A, 2‚Ä≤-O-methyladenosine (2OMeA)**
- **Pseudouridine (pseU), 2‚Ä≤-O-methyluridine (2OMeU)**
- **2‚Ä≤-O-methylguanosine (2OMeG)**

This data includes both **HEK293T Total RNA** and **in vitro transcribed (IVT) RNA** controls, processed and filtered for reads mapped to chromosome 22.
